    How do I roll back in Terraform? Suppose I lost the infrastructure.
    What are backends in Terraform?
    What are provisioners in Terraform?
    What is data block in Terraform?

     Okay, code to deploy I'll give simple task only virtual machine in Azure it includes provider.tf, main.tf, locals.tf, and variables.tf. If you don't know about these files, just let me know. Can you share the screen?
    You can write all these files with the basics thing. You can take reference from Google also. But I need that code to be changed to a method where you have to variabilize that. In Google you'll get it with list of resource blocks, right? That you need to convert it to low variables and locals and other things again.
