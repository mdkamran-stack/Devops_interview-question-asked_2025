# This commit is for questions asked me as devops interview in 2025

# Pepsico
==========
## What is output of Maven Build, if it is jar file or war file what command will put in docker file?
## scenario: you have one repo and want to build a pipeline to deploy to AWS (e.g., ECS, EKS, 
## how is your application is connected in frontend in your cluster 
## authentication and autherization who will manage application or loadbalancer ? 
## how it will authenticate weather user is valid or not  
## what is HIGH IO usage  
## how to export metrics to prometeus? 
##  lets say you have application java running micro services in kubernetes cluster from there to grafana
## 3 instance in 3 diff regions 
## 3 ec3 instance load from external source i have to divide traffic equally on all 3 
## git stash 
## shared lib in jenkins 

# Bristlecone interview
------------------------
### create 10 ubnut server with apache installations  /var/lib/html via terraform   
## write shell script get the process with user name kamran and kill the process   
## how to deploy application in k8s     
## how to setup k8s in eks    
## types of loadbalancer in k8s    
## how to setup hpa na vpa    
## what is selinux    
## what is loadbalncer in aws & how to setup app LB and NW LB , how network LB works    
## What is the difference between the count and for_each meta-arguments?    
## how to communicate with two infrastructure?  
## how to migrate on-perm to cloud?   
## how to communicate microservices?  

# QuessCorp
------------------
## Terraform list vs terraform show  
## IN CI/CD pipeline how to configure that pipeline run during change window and deploy app in cluster  
## In prometheus grafana lets say we have distributed monitoring lsts say resources are spread across diff region how we can build now.  
## In terraform dependecy error like linear & circular  
## What is lifecycle in TF  

# TechMahindra
---------------
## Suppose we have EKS cluster version X to upgrade upper version 3 node cluster while ensuring zero downtime? how did you do that?

## Questions: A jenkins pipeline takes 45 mins to build microservices Build how do you reduces it less tah 10 minutes without adding more agents.   
## Questions: Developers complains there is pipeline is getting failed no actionable log what do you change.
## Questions: A microservices in kubernetes become slow during peak hours no code chnage what do you investigate?  
## Questions: Elastic search cluster storage cost is expoding what is your plan?  
## Question: Kafka consumer log grows during spike how do you troubleshoot it.  
## Question: Production hotfix must go urgenty but multiple teams have ongoing change in developed branch?   
## Questions: CPU spike for a workload but no alert is triggered how do you fix monitoring?  
## Question: A service itermittently become unreachable how do you troubleshoot?   
## Question : JAVA 8 service must upgrade to JAVA17 how do you scale large migration.  
## Question: A critical incident happen at night you are esclation point what your action plan?  
## Question: How do you design a zero downtime multi region deployment?   
## Question: A deployment to production fail half way some pods are running older version some in new version what do you do?   
## Question: Jenkins pipeline is frequently fails due to intermitent network issue while pulling dependencies what your approach?   
## Question: Kafka topics retention eating up disk what your quick fix?    
## Question: your cluster root certificate expire in next 5 days what is your plan?   
## Question: your jenkins pipeline takes 20 mins before even starting unit test becasuse its download dependecies every time how do you fix it without modifying developers machine?  
## Question: Latency spike occured during high load metrics show cpu is fine but conetxt switching is high?  
## Question: A pod JVM service uses 80% cpu deposite load traffic what do you inspect?  
## A Sudden spike in 400 error occur what you check first as devops perspective?  
## You must provide a audit log for all infrastructure changes what solution do you implement 
## A micro services deployment causes API Gateway 502 error even through pods are healthy what your approach
